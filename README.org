* Old i3 config
In [[file:.config/i3/config]]. Some scripts it will try to run might not run because
they are no longer present because I don't use i3 anymore.

There is also the old [[https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks][i3-blocks]] status bar config and scripts in
[[file:.config/i3blocks/]]. This was a nice project.

* Old ~bspwm~ config
In [[file:.config/bspwm/bspwmrc]] - but this is mostly a hollow config, all of the real
stuff is in ~sxhkd~:
** ~sxhkd~ config
In [[file:.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc]]. This is the real thing. Though I don't use ~bspwm~
anymore, there are great keybinds in here: specifically the window keybinds
(lines 55-87) and desktop keybinds (lines 89-121) which do some smart things.

I also created a plugin for editing ~sxhkd~ config files in Emacs: [[https://github.com/yoavm448/sxhkd-mode][link]]

* Old ~AwesomeWM~ config
[[file:.config/awesome/awesome-screenshot.png]].

In [[file:.config/awesome/]]. There are many files Here:
+ [[file:.config/awesome/bar.lua][bar.lua]] defines a status bar, complete with responsive brightness and sound bars
+ [[file:.config/awesome/keys.lua][keys.lua]] defines my awesome keybinds
+ [[file:.config/awesome/myrc.lua][myrc.lua]]: defines some general stuff (like a wallpaper), and mostly binds ~bar.lua~ and
  [[file:.config/awesome/keys.lua][keys.lua]] together, e.g. creating keybinds that manipulate the status bar and

* Hebrew Dvorak LyX config
in [[file:.config/LyX/]] and [[file:.lyx/]]. The Dvorak-Hebrew keymap is
in [[file:.lyx/kbd/hebrew_dvorak.kmap]].

* Hebrew LaTeX preamble
[[file:texmf/tex/latex/prvt/preamble.sty]]. Hebrew compilation is recommended
through =XeLaTeX= (using =polyglossia)= . However, the preamble DOES compile with
=PDFLaTeX=, in case you need quick compilation for math previews etc. Advantages
and disadvantages of  =XeLaTeX=:
+ =hyperref= works (babel in =PDFLaTeX= screws up =hyperref= compilation)
+ =amsmthm= works (babel screws this up also)
+ Parentheses don't get swapped as in =PDFLaTeX=
+ Modern font support. Wanna do some שמשון שמן?
- ...About x7 compilation time compared to =PDFLaTeX=
- Less support from [[https://ctan.org/pkg/microtype][microtype]]

* [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] config
I intend to push some of this (mostly latex stuff) upstream to
doom someday.
+ [[file:.config/doom/config.el]] is a jumble of general config and preferences, mostly ~setq~'s
  and keybinds.
+ [[file:.config/doom/dvorak-config.el]] - just some simple dvorak stuff. I use vim with the
  default keys on top of dvorak, this is mostly so I can type normally with an
  another input method (be damned, Hebrew!).
+ [[file:.config/doom/modules/lang/math]] configure a math mode for use in LaTeX and
  org buffers. It creates the ~math-mode~ minor mode. In that module, with a
  =+heberw= flag to math module, I create a ~hebrew-math~ minor mode which adds
  convenient snippets and commands for writing LaTeX-like math in with a
  usually-Hebrew input method.
* Scripts
In [[file:.scripts/]]. The big ones are these:
+ [[file:.scripts/suspend-program][suspend-program]] prompts you with a selection of CPU-intensive programs and
  suspends (~SIGSTOP~) the selected one. Upon a second run it continues the
  suspended program.
+ [[file:.scripts/music-ctl][music-ctl]] controls ~mpd~ (through ~mpc~ client), but gives priority to ~VLC~ if
  its running and controls it instead (using ~d-bus~ through ~qdbus~).
* Wallpapers
Pretty papers in [[file:.wallpapers/]].
